## Differences from November 2025 Sequence

### Extended Engagement (10 countdown emails vs 8)
- **NEW**: 20-Day Welcome Email (builds exclusivity early)
- **NEW**: 14-Day Methodology Email (addresses skepticism, builds authority)
- **NEW**: 7-Day Accountability Email (pre-work check-in and catch-up guidance)

### Rationale for Extended Sequence
With 23 days between registration (Nov 13) and event (Dec 6), the extended sequence provides:
1. More touchpoints for engagement
2. Additional VIP conversion opportunities
3. Better pre-work accountability
4. Reduced last-minute overwhelm

### Key Differences
- **Workshop Hub**: neothinkevent.com/home (NOT neothinkday.com/home)
- **Zoom Link**: Different for December vs November
- **Email Count**: 11 total files (vs 8 for November)
- **Engagement Runway**: 20-day start (vs 9-day start for November)

---

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: November 13, 2025
**Created By**: Claude Code

**Notes for Implementation**:
- December Zoom link is DIFFERENT from November - verify correct link in day-of.html
- Workshop hub is neothinkevent.com/home (NOT neothinkday.com/home)
- Extended sequence provides more engagement touchpoints vs November
- Test automation workflow thoroughly before December 6, 2025 event
- Ensure late registration logic accounts for 20-day, 14-day, 9-day, 7-day entry points
