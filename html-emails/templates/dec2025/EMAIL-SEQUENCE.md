## Differences from November 2025 Sequence

### Extended Engagement (10 countdown emails vs 8)
- **NEW**: 20-Day Welcome Email (builds exclusivity early)
- **NEW**: 14-Day Methodology Email (addresses skepticism, builds authority)
- **NEW**: 7-Day Accountability Email (pre-work check-in and catch-up guidance)

### Rationale for Extended Sequence
With 23 days between registration (Nov 13) and event (Dec 6), the extended sequence provides:
1. More touchpoints for engagement
2. Additional VIP conversion opportunities
3. Better pre-work accountability
4. Reduced last-minute overwhelm

### Key Differences
- **Workshop Hub**: neothinkevent.com/home (NOT neothinkday.com/home)
- **Zoom Link**: Different for December vs November
- **Email Count**: 11 total files (vs 8 for November)
- **Engagement Start**: Immediate welcome follow-up (10 min after registration), then 14-day sequence

## Post-Event Segmentation

### Audience Segments
1. **All Attendees**: Value-First Week emails (5 days of value content)
2. **Non-L3 Members**: L3 follow-up sequence (gentle invitations, single reminder)
3. **VIP Members**: VIP session emails, VIP recording
4. **L3 Members Only**: Welcome party emails, L3-specific guidance

### Automation Logic
- **After L3 purchase**: Remove from non-L3 follow-up, add to welcome party sequence
- **Value-First Week**: ALL attendees receive regardless of L3/VIP status
- **VIP purchasers**: Receive VIP session emails in addition to general emails
- **Non-purchasers**: Continue receiving deadline sequence until midnight Wed
