The VIP Session just ended. The breakthroughs were real. The energy was electric.

Level 3 members experienced it all.

If you're still on the fence, this is your sign.

## Implementation Notes

**GHL Workflow:** L3 Post-VIP (Non-L3 only)
**Trigger:** Scheduled at +2d 10h from T=0, condition: NOT tag:level-3

**Conditional Logic:**
- ONLY send if contact does NOT have tag: `level-3`
- IF contact purchases L3 before send time → Do NOT send

**Key Dates:**
- VIP Session: Monday Dec 8, 7pm ET (4pm PT)
- This SMS: Monday Dec 8, 9pm ET (after VIP ends)
- Welcome Party: Wednesday Dec 10, 7pm ET (4pm PT)
- Deadline: Wednesday Dec 10, midnight ET

**Tone:**
- Gentle FOMO, not pushy
- Acknowledges they missed something real
- Single touch — respects their space

**Pairs With:**
- Email: `level3-ascend.html` (same time)

## Why One SMS (Not Four)

**Previous approach (v4):** 4 SMS messages on Monday (9am, 2pm, 7pm, 9pm)
**Current approach (v5):** Single SMS at 9pm after VIP Session

**Rationale:**
- Non-L3 already receives Golden Life Sheet at 9am (Value-First Week)
- Bombarding with 4 L3 pitches on same day undermines value-first philosophy
- Post-VIP timing is most effective — real FOMO vs manufactured urgency
- Wednesday gentle reminder provides the soft close

**Version:** 3.0
**Updated:** December 17, 2025
**Changed:** Simplified from 4 SMS to 1 (post-VIP only). Morning/midday/afternoon messages archived.
