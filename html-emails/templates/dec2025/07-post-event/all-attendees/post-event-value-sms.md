## Notes for Implementation

**Compliance Checklist:**
- [x] Sender identification in each message
- [x] Opt-out language in first message of sequence
- [x] No spam trigger words
- [x] No unusual language that could be flagged
- [x] Full URLs (no shorteners)
- [x] Character counts optimized

**Link Tracking:**
- Use GHL's built-in link tracking (auto-wraps full URLs)
- Do NOT use external shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl) — these are blocked by carriers
- Note: FNE Workbook is a direct PDF download, so SMS points to email

**Personalization (Optional):**
- Can add `{{contact.first_name}}` after "Neothink Society:"
- Example: "Neothink Society: Hi {{contact.first_name}}, your Golden Life Sheet..."

**Tone:**
- Honoring and celebratory, not pushy
- Focused on providing value they already earned
- No urgency or pressure language
- Simple, direct, helpful

**Compressed Timeline Rationale:**
- Delivers all value resources before the weekend
- Allows attendees to have tools in hand for weekend reflection
- Closes the value loop on Friday, avoiding Monday overlap with other sequences
- Aligns with Level 3 Welcome Party (Wed) and deadline (Wed midnight) timing
