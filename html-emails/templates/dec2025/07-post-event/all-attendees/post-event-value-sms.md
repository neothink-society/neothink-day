## Notes for Implementation

**Character Counts:**
- SMS 1: ~185 chars (may split into 2 segments)
- SMS 2: ~180 chars (may split into 2 segments)
- SMS 3: ~215 chars (may split into 2 segments)
- SMS 4: ~215 chars (may split into 2 segments)

**Link Tracking:**
- Replace links with tracked short links if using GoHighLevel SMS tracking
- Note: FNE Workbook is a direct PDF download, so SMS points to email

**Personalization (Optional):**
- Add `{{contact.first_name}}` at start: "Hey {{contact.first_name}},"

**Tone:**
- Honoring and celebratory, not pushy
- Focused on providing value they already earned
- No urgency or pressure language

**Compressed Timeline Rationale:**
- Delivers all value resources before the weekend
- Allows attendees to have tools in hand for weekend reflection
- Closes the value loop on Friday, avoiding Monday overlap with other sequences
- Aligns with Level 3 Welcome Party (Wed) and deadline (Wed midnight) timing
