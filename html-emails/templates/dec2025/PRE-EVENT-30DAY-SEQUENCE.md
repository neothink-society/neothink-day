# 30-Day Pre-Event Sequence Design
## Day of Enlightenment — December 6, 2025

**Event Start:** Saturday, December 6, 2025 @ 8:00 AM Pacific / 11:00 AM Eastern

---

## SEQUENCE PHILOSOPHY

### The Mortal Mentality Journey

Attendees register in a state of **Mortal Mentality**:
- Mind burdened with "what ifs" and limitations
- Heart yearning but feeling inadequate
- Hands working but not creating value
- Shoes walking paths chosen by others
- Head filled with the Matrix of Illusions

The 30-day sequence must:
1. **Meet them where they are** (acknowledge the burden)
2. **Create cracks in the illusion** (gentle questioning)
3. **Build anticipation** (without hype or pressure)
4. **Prepare them mentally** (what to expect, how to arrive)
5. **Accelerate excitement** (final days)

### Cadence Principle

**Weeks 4-3 (Days 30-15):** Low frequency, high impact
- 1-2 emails per week
- Deep, reflective content
- Meeting them in Mortal Mentality

**Week 2 (Days 14-8):** Building momentum
- 2-3 emails per week
- Practical preparation
- Anticipation building

**Week 1 (Days 7-1):** High frequency, high energy
- Daily emails + SMS
- Logistics + excitement
- VIP differentiation
