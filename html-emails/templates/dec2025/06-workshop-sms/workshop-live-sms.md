## MESSAGING PHILOSOPHY

**Purpose of Each Message:**
- **LIVE/Opening messages**: Get people in the room who aren't there
- **Break messages**: Permission to step away + return time
- **Return messages**: Urgent recall to the room
- **Segment messages**: FOMO creation for critical content
- **End messages**: Celebration + next steps

**Key Principles:**
- Acknowledge people already in the room first ("If you're in the room — we see you")
- Keep it punchy — SMS reads on mobile
- Always include Zoom link for "rejoin" messages
- Break messages don't need Zoom link (they'll return same link)
- Segment alerts create urgency without shame

**Character Counts:**
- All messages under 450 characters (fits in 3 SMS segments)
- Critical "LIVE" messages optimized for fast reading
