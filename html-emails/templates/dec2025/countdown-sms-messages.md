## STRATEGIC NOTES

**Key Messaging Principles:**
- Emphasize "opening sets the foundation" and "every moment matters"
- Create urgency to be there from the start without revealing specific content
- Day 2 messages reference "building on Day 1 foundation"
- Progressive urgency: informational → reminder → urgent → LIVE

**Character Counts:**
- All messages optimized for SMS delivery (under 320 characters where possible)
- Links included starting at 1-hour mark when Zoom room typically opens
- Zoom credentials included in "1 hour before" messages for manual entry backup
