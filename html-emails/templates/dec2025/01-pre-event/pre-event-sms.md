- **Foster anticipation** — transformation is coming, prepare for it

### What TO Reveal:
- Pre-work requirements (Secret Manuscript, Workbook)
- Logistics (start times, tech requirements)
- General themes (transformation, patterns, value creation)
- Preparation guidance (physical, mental, environmental)

### What NOT to Reveal:
- Specific session times during the workshop
- Detailed content of exercises or revelations

- Physical and mental preparation guidance
- No one arrives wondering "what should I have done?"

### Build Anticipation Without Spoiling
- General themes, not specific revelations
- "Something powerful awaits" > "Here's exactly what happens"
- Create curiosity, not a checklist of what they'll experience

### Grace for All Stages
- If they're ahead — validate them
- If they're behind — no shame, practical help
- Focus on showing up, not perfection

### Tone Principles
- **Professional but warm** — not salesy, not cold
- **Urgent but calm** — important without panic
- **Specific but mysterious** — clear instructions, hidden revelations
