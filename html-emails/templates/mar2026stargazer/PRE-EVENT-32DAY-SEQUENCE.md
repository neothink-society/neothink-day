## AUDIENCE CONTEXT

These are **Level 3 Stargazers** — not first-time Neothink attendees.

They have:
- Completed at least one Day of Enlightenment (Level 2)
- A Golden Life Sheet already written
- Fluency with FNE, Immortal Mentality, Value Creator concepts
- Made a larger financial and psychological commitment than L2

The Stargazer Immersion is the next level: **application and implementation**, not introduction.

Messaging must reflect this. Do not re-explain what they already know.

---

## MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### "The Starship" — Core Metaphor (from landing page)

> "The Day of Enlightenment built the Launchpad. This is the Starship."

Use this language. They are not arriving somewhere new — they are **launching**.

### Three-Day Arc (from welcome-home.html)
- **Day 1 (Friday, March 27):** Removing Internal Limitations — the hidden program, false commands, generational shadows. The "Real You" emerges with mistake-free focus.
- **Day 2 (Saturday, March 28):** Removing Monetary Limitations — Mark Hamilton's private turnkey tools behind $400M+ in wealth creation. Family dynasty secrets. Personal wealth blueprint. Million Dollar Vision made mathematically inevitable.
- **Day 3 (Sunday, March 29):** Removing External Limitations — building the life architecture that lets the Unreachable Star become inevitable.

### What to Reveal vs. Protect
**Reveal:**
- Pre-work requirements (intake questionnaire, Golden Life Sheet)
- Logistics (start times, Zoom format, 3-day commitment)
- The three-day thematic arc (internal → monetary → external)
- The intimate, small-group format ("not a broadcast")

**Protect:**
- Specific exercises and session details during the event
- Exact timing of each day's content
- What Mark Hamilton will say or show specifically

### Tone vs. Level Two
| L2 DOE | L3 Stargazer |
|--------|-------------|
| Discovery, introduction | Implementation, application |
| "You'll learn about..." | "You'll execute on..." |
| Philosophical buildup | Practical + philosophical |
| Mysterious | Direct and elevated |
| Broad audience | Intimate cohort |

## PRE-WORK EMPHASIS

The **intake questionnaire** is the most critical pre-work item for this event (unlike L2 where reading was primary). It enables the Hamilton family to personalize the immersion to each attendee's specific situation — business, finances, personal life.

**Call to action order:**
1. Complete intake questionnaire (link: `{{custom_values.sg_intake_form_url}}`) — ⚠️ pending
2. Have Golden Life Sheet from DOE ready (not written again — bring the one they have)
3. Block all three days completely
4. Camera on — small group, everyone in the room
