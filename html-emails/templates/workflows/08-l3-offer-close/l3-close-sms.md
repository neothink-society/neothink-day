## Notes

- SMS should only go to attendees WITHOUT `level-3` tag
- Stop sending if contact purchases L3 at any point
- Avoid trigger words like "LAST CHANCE" or "DON'T MISS"
- Include "Neothink Society:" prefix for carrier compliance
- Keep messages factual and respectful (not pushy)
- Final SMS should acknowledge it's the last message
