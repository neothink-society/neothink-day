Over two days, you will receive tools and insights designed to shift your operating system permanently.

Begin preparing your mind: permanent transformation is possible.

Mark your calendar. {{custom_values.doe_event_dates}}. Your life is waiting.

## 10 Days Before

```
Neothink Society: 10 days. Time to identify your dream.

Over the past weeks, you've read material showing impossible dreams can become reality.

Focus on clarifying what YOU want:

If you operated from certainty instead of fear, what impossible dream would you create?

Hold that thought. Carry it into {{custom_values.doe_day_1_date_short}}.

The workshop will show you how to make it real.

Your body supports your mind. Prepare both.

We have short breaks — pre-prepare snacks and lunch. You won't want to leave for food runs.

Fair warning: Some moments will feel uncomfortable. Maybe even awkward.

This is intentional.

The greatest breakthroughs happen when your comfort zone is interrupted. Together, we'll move beyond the patterns that have been restricting your life.

Prepare to participate fully. Lean into the discomfort.

You are in a safe environment of fellow seekers.

Transformation lives on the other side of comfort.
