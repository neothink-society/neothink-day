## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing (And Why)

❌ **Multiple SMS countdown** (too spammy)
- Original had 0 SMS and worked fine
- 1 SMS at critical moment is enough

❌ **Friday night SMS** (unnecessary)
- Friday morning email already covered everything
- Let people sleep, don't interrupt evening

❌ **6:00 AM Email + SMS together** (redundant)
- Email is comprehensive, give it time to work
- SMS at 7:30 is the strategic moment

❌ **7:55 AM "5 MINUTES" push** (too aggressive)
- If they haven't joined by 7:30, it's their choice
- One SMS is professional, two is pushy

❌ **"LIVE NOW" email at 8:00 AM** (too late)
- Original only used this for BONUS sessions (optional)
- Main workshop has high commitment, don't need it
