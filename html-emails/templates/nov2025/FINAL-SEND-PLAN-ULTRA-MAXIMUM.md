## 🎯 Expected Results with 9am Wallace Reveal

**Progressive Attendance Build:**
- 6:00-7:00 AM: Emails arriving, people waking up
- 7:30 AM: First joins (25-35%)
- 8:00 AM: Major influx (50-60% total)
- 8:30 AM: Wallace countdown (70-80% total)
- 8:45 AM: Final push (85-90% total)
- **9:00 AM Wallace reveal push: 93-97% attendance** ⭐

**Why 9:00 AM Works:**
- Wallace is ACTUALLY on stage revealing something
- Creates massive FOMO ("revealing it NOW")
- Catches people checking phone at top of hour
- Not interrupting those already watching (they're focused on Wallace)
- Final stragglers who haven't joined realize what they're missing

**Emails:** 4 emails × ~free = $0
**SMS:** 5 SMS × 500 attendees = 2,500 SMS × $0.008 = ~$125-250

**ROI:**
- Expected attendance gain: +6-12% vs original plan
- Additional attendees: 30-60 people
- VIP value: $297 × 30-60 = **$8,910-17,820 value**

## ✅ Why 9:00 AM Wallace Reveal Push Works

### Perfect Timing
- Wallace is ACTUALLY on stage (not a countdown)
- Top of the hour (people naturally check phones)
- "Revealing it NOW" creates immediate urgency
- Catches final stragglers who were on fence

### Psychological FOMO
- "He's revealing the breakthrough" - mystery + urgency
- "Don't miss this moment" - fear of missing out
- Creates realization: "Oh shit, Wallace is speaking RIGHT NOW"
- Final push that works because it's TRUE (not fake urgency)

### Not Spam
- Email + SMS simultaneous (counts as 1 touchpoint psychologically)
- 9am is natural break time (hour mark)
- Different from countdowns (this is "it's happening")
- Those already in workshop aren't bothered (watching Wallace)

### Strategic Brilliance
- Skip 8:55 AM (too close, feels desperate)
- Wait for 9:00 AM when Wallace actually speaks
- Create FOMO around actual event, not countdown
- Final absolute last chance that feels justified
