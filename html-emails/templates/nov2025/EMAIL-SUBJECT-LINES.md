## Subject Line Best Practices Applied

### ✅ What We Did Right:

1. **Numbers in subject lines** - Creates urgency and specificity
2. **Under 50 characters** - Mobile-friendly (most are 35-45 chars)
3. **Action-oriented** - Clear what they need to do
4. **Urgency without panic** - Motivating, not stressful
5. **Emojis used sparingly** - Only VIP and LIVE emails (2 of 8)
6. **Preview text complements** - Doesn't repeat subject line
7. **Front-loaded important info** - Key words at the beginning

### 📱 Mobile Optimization:

All subject lines display fully on:
- iPhone (35-40 chars visible)
- Android (40-45 chars visible)
- Desktop (50+ chars visible)

### 🎯 Conversion Psychology:

- **9-Day**: Assignment framing (creates accountability)
- **4-Day**: Emphasis on "BOTH" (prevents partial attendance)
- **3-Day**: Scarcity + emoji (drives VIP conversions)
- **2-Day**: Checklist approach (actionable, concrete)
- **1-Day**: Specific time (sets expectation, reduces anxiety)
- **Day-Of**: Maximum urgency + emoji (impossible to ignore)

## A/B Testing Recommendations

If you want to test subject lines, consider:

1. **9-Day Email**: Test "Your Pre-Work Starts Now" vs "Assignment Due Before Nov 22"
2. **3-Day Email**: Test emoji vs no emoji versions
3. **Day-Of Email**: Test red circle emoji vs video camera emoji

Track:
- Open rates
- Click-through rates
- VIP conversion rates (for 3-day email)
