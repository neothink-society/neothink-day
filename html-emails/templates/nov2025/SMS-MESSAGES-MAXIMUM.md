## Recommended SMS Strategy

### FINAL STRATEGY: 5 SMS with Anticipation Build ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**SMS Sequence:**
- **7:30 AM:** Doors open NOW - join immediately
- **8:00 AM:** Workshop starting NOW - strong urgency
- **8:30 AM:** Build anticipation - "Something big is coming"
- **8:45 AM:** Increase anticipation - "Major reveal about to happen"
- **9:00 AM:** Big reveal happening NOW - maximum FOMO

**Total:** 5 SMS over 90 minutes
**Cost:** ~$125-250 (5 SMS × 500 attendees)
**Expected attendance:** 92-96%

**Why This Strategy Works:**
- **Respects the first hour (8-9am):** Doesn't downplay valuable content happening
- **Builds anticipation progressively:** Creates excitement without making it a countdown
- **Dual-purpose messaging:** Works for both stragglers (join!) and attendees (stay engaged!)
- **9am FOMO moment:** Catches final stragglers + refocuses existing attendees
- **Professional frequency:** 1 SMS every 18 minutes, not spammy
- **No explicit mentions:** Doesn't reveal Wallace or content details

**Expected Results:**
- By 7:30 AM: 25-35% joined (early birds)
- By 8:00 AM: 50-60% joined (official start - strong push)
- By 8:30 AM: 70-80% joined (anticipation builds engagement)
- By 8:45 AM: 85-90% joined (final urgency push)
- By 9:00 AM: 92-96% attendance (big reveal FOMO catches final 2-6%)

### Message Quality
- ✅ Always include Zoom link
- ✅ Keep under 160 characters when possible

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't send after 8:55 AM (too late, Wallace speaking)

## Day 2 SMS Strategy Notes

**Timing Differences from Day 1:**

- **Morning reminder (7am):** Gentle wake-up, low-pressure
- **Progressive urgency:** 30min → 15min → NOW
- **Familiar structure:** Same pattern as Day 1 for consistency
- **Cost-effective:** 4 SMS vs 5 SMS saves 20% on Day 2

**Expected Results:**
- By 7:00 AM: Awareness, people waking up
- By 8:30 AM: 40-50% already planning to join
- By 8:45 AM: 70-80% preparing to join
- By 9:00 AM: 90-95% attendance (slightly lower than Day 1 is normal)
