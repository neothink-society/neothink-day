**Character Count:** 166 (fits in 1 SMS)
**Expected:** 98% open rate, 3-5% final final final stragglers

**Why This Works:**
- Wallace is ACTUALLY on stage revealing something transformational
- Creates massive FOMO (fear of missing out)
- "The breakthrough is happening" - urgency without revealing details
- Catches anyone checking phone at 9am who hasn't joined yet
- Not interrupting those already in (they're watching Wallace)

## My Recommendation: OPTION B (5 SMS with 9:00 AM Wallace Reveal) ⭐ UPDATED

**Why:**
- 7:30, 8:00, 8:30, 8:45 AM = essential countdown sequence
- **SKIP 8:55 AM** (too close to Wallace, feels desperate)
- **ADD 9:00 AM Wallace reveal** (creates FOMO when he's actually on stage)
- Wallace reveal SMS catches final stragglers checking phone at top of hour
- Not spammy: 5 SMS over 90 minutes = 1 every 18 minutes
- Professional but maximally effective

**Expected Results:**
- By 7:30 AM: 25-35% joined (early birds)
- By 8:00 AM: 50-60% joined (official start)
- By 8:30 AM: 70-80% joined (Wallace countdown)
- By 8:45 AM: 85-90% joined (final push)
- By 9:00 AM Wallace SMS: 92-96% attendance (FOMO catches final 2-6%)
