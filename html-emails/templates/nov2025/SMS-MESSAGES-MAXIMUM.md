## Recommended SMS Strategy

### OPTION A: Maximum (5 SMS)
- 7:30 AM: Doors open
- 8:00 AM: Starting now
- 8:30 AM: Wallace in 30 min
- 8:45 AM: Wallace in 15 min
- 8:55 AM: Wallace in 5 min

**Total:** 5 SMS over 85 minutes
**Cost:** ~$125-250
**Expected attendance:** 92-96%

---

### OPTION B: Aggressive (4 SMS) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- 7:30 AM: Doors open
- 8:00 AM: Starting now
- 8:30 AM: Wallace in 30 min
- 8:45 AM: Wallace in 15 min

**Total:** 4 SMS over 75 minutes
**Cost:** ~$100-200
**Expected attendance:** 91-95%
**Why:** 8:55 AM might be too much, 8:45 AM is final final call

---

### OPTION C: Moderate (3 SMS)
- 7:30 AM: Doors open
- 8:00 AM: Starting now
- 8:30 AM: Wallace in 30 min

**Total:** 3 SMS over 60 minutes
**Cost:** ~$75-150
**Expected attendance:** 90-94%

---

## My Recommendation: OPTION B (4 SMS)

**Why:**
- 8:55 AM SMS is TOO close to Wallace (only 5 min before)
- People already in Zoom by 8:45 if they're coming
- 5 SMS in 85 minutes starts to feel desperate
- 4 SMS is aggressive but professional

**Expected Results:**
- By 7:30 AM: 25-35% joined (early birds)
- By 8:00 AM: 50-60% joined (official start)
- By 8:30 AM: 70-80% joined (Wallace countdown)
- By 8:45 AM: 85-90% joined (final push)
- By 9:00 AM: 91-95% attendance (Wallace takes stage)

## SMS Best Practices

### Timing
- ✅ Send at exact times (no delays)
- ✅ Space at least 15 minutes apart
- ✅ Final SMS no later than 8:45 AM (15 min buffer)

### Message Quality
- ✅ Always include Zoom link
- ✅ Keep under 160 characters when possible
- ✅ Use emojis for visual urgency (🔴 ⚡)
- ✅ Always sign "- Neothink Society"

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't send after 8:55 AM (too late, Wallace speaking)
- ❌ Don't send more than 5 SMS total (spam)
- ❌ Don't use ALL CAPS (feels shouty on mobile)
- ❌ Don't forget Zoom link in ANY message
