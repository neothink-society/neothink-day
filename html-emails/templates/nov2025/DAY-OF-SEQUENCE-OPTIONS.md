# Day-of Communication Sequence - Options
## Wallace Takes Stage at 9:00 AM PT (Critical Context)

**Key Insight:** Since Wallace doesn't take the stage until 9:00 AM PT, we have a FULL HOUR of buffer time (8:00-9:00 AM) where we can send aggressive reminders without interrupting the actual workshop.

**Timeline:**
- 7:30 AM: Doors open
- 8:00 AM: "Official start" (gathering, tech checks, community building)
- **9:00 AM: Wallace takes the stage** ← THE ACTUAL START

This changes everything - we can be aggressive without being disruptive!

Same as Option B + add:

**Risk:** Might feel TOO aggressive, border on spam

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION: Option B (7 Touchpoints, Skip 8:45 AM)

### **The Final Sequence:**

| Time | Type | Subject/Message | Purpose |
|------|------|-----------------|---------|
| 6:00 AM | Email | 🔴 TODAY: Doors Open in 90 Minutes | Comprehensive prep |
| 7:00 AM | Email | ⏰ 1 HOUR: Doors Open at 7:30 AM PT | Countdown to doors |
| 7:30 AM | SMS | 🔴 DOORS ARE OPEN NOW | Mobile urgent push |
| 8:00 AM | Email | 🔴 WE'RE STARTING NOW | Official start push |
| 8:00 AM | SMS | 🔴 WE'RE STARTING NOW | Mobile redundancy |
| 8:30 AM | SMS | ⚡ WALLACE IN 30 MINUTES | Final call |

**Total: 3 Emails + 3 SMS = 6 Touchpoints over 2.5 hours**

---

## Why This Works:

### **Email Strategy:**
- **6:00 AM:** Comprehensive (people checking email with morning coffee)
- **7:00 AM:** Countdown urgency (building momentum)
- **8:00 AM:** Maximum urgency (official start, final comprehensive push)

### **SMS Strategy:**
- **7:30 AM:** Doors open (THE critical mobile moment)
- **8:00 AM:** Official start (redundancy with email, different channel)
- **8:30 AM:** Wallace countdown (final call for stragglers)

### **Timing Psychology:**
- 6-7 AM: Information phase (people waking up, getting ready)
- 7:30 AM: Action phase (doors open, join NOW)
- 8:00 AM: Urgency phase (official start, last comprehensive push)
- 8:30 AM: Desperation phase (Wallace in 30 min, truly final call)

---

## Emails We Need to Create:

1. **7:00 AM Email:** 1-hour countdown to doors open
   - File: `countdown-1hour.html`
   - Theme: Red accent, urgency building
   - Content: "Doors open in 1 hour (7:30 AM PT), final tech check"

2. **8:00 AM Email:** Official start / WE'RE STARTING NOW
   - File: `starting-now.html`
   - Theme: Full RED theme (like bonus-live.html from October)
   - Content: Minimal text, maximum urgency, "WE'RE STARTING NOW"

---

## Expected Results:

**By 7:30 AM:** 20-30% joined (early birds)
**By 8:00 AM:** 50-60% joined (official start push)
**By 8:30 AM:** 70-80% joined (Wallace countdown)
**By 9:00 AM:** 90-95% attendance ⭐

**vs Original Plan (2 touchpoints):** 85-90% attendance

**Gain:** +5-10% attendance through aggressive multi-channel approach

---

## Cost Analysis:

**Option B (Recommended):**
- 3 emails (cost: ~$0)
- 3 SMS × estimated 500 attendees = 1,500 SMS
- Cost: ~$75-150 depending on SMS provider
- **ROI:** $297 VIP × 25-50 additional attendees = $7,425-14,850 value

**Worth it? ABSOLUTELY.**

## What Do You Think?

**Questions for you:**

1. **Do you like Option B (6 touchpoints)?** Or prefer Option A (5) or Option C (8)?

2. **Should we send Email + SMS simultaneously at 8:00 AM?** Or stagger them (8:00 AM email, 8:05 AM SMS)?

3. **8:45 AM final SMS?** Include or skip? (I lean skip - 8:30 is enough)

4. **Should we mention Wallace timing in the emails?** Or keep that internal knowledge and just say "starting now"?

Let me know your preferences and I'll build the missing emails!
