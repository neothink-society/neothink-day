## 🎯 WHY THIS WORKS

### Wallace's 9 AM Start Creates Perfect Window
- 7:30 AM: Doors open (safe to be aggressive)
- 8:00 AM: "Official start" (community building hour)
- **9:00 AM: Wallace speaks** (actual workshop content)
- Full hour (8-9am) for aggressive reminders WITHOUT disruption

### Multi-Channel Redundancy
- Email: Comprehensive info (desktop users)
- SMS: Mobile urgency (98% open rate)
- Combined: Maximum reach

### Progressive Urgency
- Early: Information ("doors in 90 min")
- Middle: Action ("doors open now")
- Late: Urgency ("starting now")
- Final: Desperation ("Wallace in 15 min")

### Professional Yet Aggressive
- 7 touchpoints over 2.75 hours = 1 every 24 minutes
- Each serves distinct purpose
- Justified by $297 VIP + high-value content
- Stops 15 min before Wallace (respectful buffer)

---
