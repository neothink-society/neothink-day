# November 22, 2025 Workshop - FINAL Send Plan
## MAXIMUM STRATEGY - Wallace Takes Stage at 9:00 AM

**Created:** November 21, 2025
**Event:** Saturday, November 22, 2025 @ 8:00 AM PT (doors), 9:00 AM PT (Wallace)
**Decision:** MAXIMUM AGGRESSION - Wallace buffer allows aggressive reminders

---

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHT: Wallace Doesn't Speak Until 9:00 AM

**Critical Context:**
- **7:30 AM:** Doors open
- **8:00 AM:** "Official start" (gathering, tech checks, community)
- **9:00 AM:** Wallace Hamilton takes the stage ← THE ACTUAL START

**Implication:** We have a FULL HOUR (8-9am) to send aggressive reminders without interrupting the workshop!

**Strategy:** Use this buffer for maximum mobile-first communication

## ✅ Why This Strategy Works

### **Respects Wallace's 9am Start:**
- All aggressive communication happens BEFORE Wallace speaks
- No interruptions during actual workshop content
- 15-minute buffer (8:45am last message → 9am Wallace)

### **Multi-Channel Redundancy:**
- Email: Comprehensive information (20-30% open rate)
- SMS: Mobile-first urgency (98% open rate)
- Combined: Maximum reach

### **Progressive Urgency:**
- 6-7 AM: Information phase (comprehensive logistics)
- 7:30 AM: Action phase (doors open, join now)
- 8:00 AM: Urgency phase (starting now, maximum push)
- 8:30-8:45 AM: Desperation phase (Wallace countdown, final calls)

### **Professional Yet Aggressive:**
- Not spammy: 7 touchpoints over 2.75 hours = 1 every 24 minutes
- Each message serves distinct purpose
- Aggressive but justified by high-value event

---

## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing

❌ **Sending after 8:45 AM** (8:55 SMS is optional, not recommended)
- Wallace speaks at 9:00 AM
- Too close, feels desperate
- People already in Zoom

❌ **More than 8 total touchpoints**
- Would cross into spam territory
- Diminishing returns

❌ **Messages without Zoom link**
- Every single message includes Zoom link
- One-click join always available
