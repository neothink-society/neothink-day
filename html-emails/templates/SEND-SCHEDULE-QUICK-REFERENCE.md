## 🎯 GoHighLevel Setup Notes

### Timezone Settings
- **CRITICAL**: Set all automations to **Pacific Time (PT)**
- December is PST (Pacific Standard Time) - no DST

### Automation Logic
1. Registration triggers immediate confirmation email
2. VIP purchase triggers immediate VIP confirmation
3. All countdown emails triggered by "days before event" calculation
4. Use "Wait until specific time" workflow step for each send time

### Late Registration Handling

**NOVEMBER (Bridge + Countdown Structure):**
- **Register Thu Nov 13 - Sun Nov 16**: Get Bridge emails → Sync to countdown Mon Nov 17
- **Register Mon Nov 17 or later**: Skip bridge emails → Catch up to current countdown day

Examples:
- Register Thu Nov 13 → Welcome immediately → Methodology +24h → Day 5 on Mon Nov 17
- Register Sat Nov 15 → Welcome immediately → Methodology +24h → Day 5 on Mon Nov 17
- Register Sun Nov 16 → Welcome immediately → Skip methodology → Day 5 on Mon Nov 17
- Register Mon Nov 17 → Skip bridge → Day 5 immediately
- Register Tue Nov 18 → Skip bridge → Day 4 immediately
- Register Wed Nov 19 → Skip bridge → Day 3 immediately

**DECEMBER (Standard Countdown):**
- Register 18 days before → Send Day 20 email immediately
- Register 12 days before → Send Day 14 email immediately
- Register 8 days before → Send Day 9 email immediately
- Register 5 days before → Send Day 4 email immediately
- etc.

### Email Frequency (Automated Pacing)

**NOVEMBER:**
- **Bridge Phase (Nov 13-16)**: 2 emails over 4 days (immediate + 24h)
- **Countdown Phase (Nov 17-22)**: 6 emails over 6 days (daily)

**DECEMBER:**
- **Days 20-9**: Every 5-6 days (building anticipation)
- **Days 9-3**: Every 2 days (increasing urgency)
- **Days 3-0**: Daily (final countdown)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All send times set to Pacific Time (PT)
- [ ] Zoom links correct for each event (different links!)
- [ ] Workshop hub URLs correct (neothinkday.com vs neothinkevent.com)
- [ ] Subject lines copied exactly (including emojis)
- [ ] Preview text copied exactly
- [ ] Late registration logic tested
- [ ] Day-of email sends at exactly 7:00 AM PT

## 📊 Send Time Strategy

### Early Morning (7am-9am PT)
**Who**: Day 9, Day 7, Day 3, Day 0
**Why**: Action-required emails, top of inbox, full day to complete tasks

### Mid-Morning (9am-11am PT)
**Who**: Day 20, Day 14, Day 4, Day 2
**Why**: Planning emails, people settled into day, read thoroughly

### Evening (6pm PT)
**Who**: Day 1 ONLY
**Why**: Read before bed, set alarms overnight, mental preparation

### Immediate (24/7)
**Who**: Registration, VIP confirmation
**Why**: Instant gratification, confirms transaction immediately
