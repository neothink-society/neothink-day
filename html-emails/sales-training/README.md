## What We're Training On

**Main Offer:** The Society Level Three membership package
**Down-Sell:** New monthly subscription membership

**Context:** This is short notice - for some this is their FIRST notice sent just hours before the training. They need to be ready to support hundreds of buyers during BOTH upcoming 2-day workshops (Nov 22-23 AND Dec 6-7). Saturday is a full day, Sunday is at least partial day (TBD). Many buyers are not technically inclined and will need assistance in breakout rooms.

**What the team will do:**
- Help members purchase The Society Level Three membership package
- Offer the monthly subscription as a down-sell option
- Provide technical assistance in breakout rooms
- Handle high volume of buyers during the workshop

This is the next generation of core experiences for members of The Neothink Society.
